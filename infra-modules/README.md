# Cloudkite infrastructure

The main stack provisions project APIs, IAM, networking, GKE, Cloud SQL,
Cloud DNS, and optional Cloud Build triggers. Application images are built and
pushed to Docker Hub by the application pipeline.

## Bootstrap

1. Apply `bootstrap/` locally to create the versioned GCS state bucket.
2. Apply the main stack locally once to create the Terraform automation service
   account and its IAM roles.
3. Set `terraform_state_bucket_name`, `github_repository_owner`, and
   `github_repository_name` in `terraform.tfvars`.
4. Connect the repository through the Cloud Build GitHub App.
5. Set `enable_cloud_build_triggers = true` and apply once more.

After bootstrap, `feature/*` infrastructure changes run formatting,
initialization, validation, and plan through `cloudbuild-infra.yaml`. Changes
merged to `main` create a plan and wait for Cloud Build approval before applying
that exact plan.

The infrastructure pipeline creates `backend.generated.tf` only inside its
ephemeral workspace, so local backend configuration remains explicit.
